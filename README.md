## Contributing
Right now no contributionn is needed, except for the reworked shop icons. A samll sideproject of TTT2 is the rework of ugly TTT weapon icons in the shop. There's a color specification in TTT which nobody seems to mind and some people don't even know, that there are template files. <br>
